                <h1>What is ITLP Anyway?</h1>
                <p>What's there to say? It's the single best thing you can ever
                   hope to do for your IT career. In this digital world, technology
                   is shaping every aspect of every profession. GE is at the forefront of
                   this change and you, you! have the opportunity to be part of the movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                Not to mention we have a one-of-a-kind partnership with Indiana University to bring
                the best and latest information technology education to our program members. No one
                spends more money on training than, no one.
                </p>

                <h3>What kind of projects will I do?</h3>
                <p>A better question will be what won't you do! We have everything from:
                <ul>

                    <li>Application Development</li>

                    <li>And much much more!</li>
                </ul>

                <p>But why should you listen to me blabber. Why don't you see for yourself!</p>
